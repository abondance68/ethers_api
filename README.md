# Project : A demo about Ethers API library

- For example, the file named "ethers.js" will retrieve the current block number of Eth Mainnet or Polygon Mainnet.




To use the app, you have to create a .env file where you will place your own JSON RPC provider https endpoints from infura or alchemy for example.
